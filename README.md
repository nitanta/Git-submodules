Modularize project using swift packages
Swift package is hosted on a different repo

Two ways to use package
• Using github url to import as swift package
• Locally dragging and dropping the cloned repo. This makes it easier for parallel development.

NOTE: project can import both local and remote version of package at the same time. However, priority is given to remote package

NOTE: close the package if you are opening it in a separate project at the time when you want to locally import it.
